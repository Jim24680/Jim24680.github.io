    <h2 id="projectDescription">About the Project</h2>
    <p id="projectDescription">Finding public soccer fields that are high quality can be a challenge, so our website aims to make playing soccer in the DMV more accessible. During the first 2-3 weeks of the project, we took multiple courses on website development, which involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Afterwards, we explored 8 different fields in the area and took note of their surface quality and amenities. Finally, we put it all together; this website has all the data we collected, and itâ€™s a visual representation of the skills we have learned.</p>

    <h2 id="ratingDescription">Our Rating System</h2>
    <p id="ratingDescription">Our field ratings are mainly driven by the field quality, but we also consider other aspects of the park, including water fountains, proximity to public transportation, and group reservations. At the end, we give each site a rating out of 10. </p>
