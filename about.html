    <h2 class="sections">About the Project</h2>
    <p id="projectDescription">Finding public soccer fields that are high quality can be a challenge, so our website aims to make playing soccer in the DMV more accessible. During the first 2-3 weeks of the project, we took multiple courses on website development, which involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Afterwards, we explored 8 different fields in the area and took note of their surface quality and amenities. Finally, we put it all together; this website has all the data we collected, and itâ€™s a visual representation of the skills we have learned.</p>
